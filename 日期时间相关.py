time模块
    This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.

    There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
    of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
    or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
    The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.
    The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).

    The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
    The tuple items are:
      year (including century, e.g. 1998)
      month (1-12)
      day (1-31)
      hours (0-23)
      minutes (0-59)
      seconds (0-59)
      weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
      Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
      DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
    If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
    if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
    if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.

    Variables:

    timezone -- difference in seconds between UTC and local standard time
    altzone -- difference in  seconds between UTC and local DST time
    daylight -- whether local time should reflect DST
    tzname -- tuple of (standard time zone name, DST time zone name)

    Functions:

    time() -- return current time in seconds since the Epoch as a float
    clock() -- return CPU time since process start as a float
    sleep() -- delay for a number of seconds given as a float
    gmtime() -- convert seconds since Epoch to UTC tuple
    localtime() -- convert seconds since Epoch to local time tuple
    asctime() -- convert time tuple to string
    ctime() -- convert time in seconds to string
    mktime() -- convert local time tuple to seconds since Epoch
    strftime() -- convert time tuple to string according to format specification
    strptime() -- parse string to time tuple according to format specification
    tzset() -- change the local timezone
